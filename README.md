## What is gLabels-qt?

gLabels-qt is the development repository for the next major version of gLabels (4.0).

## What's new in glabels-4.0?

- Based on Qt instead of Gtk.
- Unlike previous versions, glabels-4.0 should be a cross-platform application.  So far, it
  has been built and tested under Linux and Windows (using MSYS/MINGW toolchain).
- It has a new general UI which helps guide the user through typical workflows.

## Status

gLabels-qt has been under off-and-on development since October 2013.
It is still missing several features to bring it in parity with glabels-3.4.  These include

- Barcode objects
- Internationalization
- Product template designer
- Online manual

## Help Needed

* Help is needed to add support to build and package glabels for other platforms.  These include

  - Windows (VisualStudio)
  - Windows (MINGW 64bit)
  - Mac
  - Linux (flatpak)
  - Linux (snap)
  - Linux (appimage)

* Help is needed writing online documentation.

* Help is needed setting up internationalization and writing translations.

* Additional internal icon themes.

* Suggestions.

* For code contributions, see [docs/HACKING.md](docs/HACKING.md).
