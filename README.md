## What is gLabels-qt?

gLabels-qt is the development repository for the next major version of gLabels (4.0).

## What's new in gLabels-qt?

- Based on the Qt cross-platform framework.
- Unlike previous versions, glabels-qt is a cross-platform application.  So far, it
  has been built and tested under both Linux and Windows 7 (using MSYS/MINGW toolchain).
- Updated general UI which helps guide the user through typical workflows.

## Status

It is still missing several features to bring it in parity with glabels-3.4.  These include

- Barcode objects
- Internationalization
- Product template designer
- Online manual

## Build Instructions

- [Linux Build Instructions](docs/BUILD-INSTRUCTIONS-LINUX.md)
- [Windows Build Instructions](docs/BUILD-INSTRUCTIONS-WINDOWS.md)
